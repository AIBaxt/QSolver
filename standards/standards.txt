IDE of choice: Visual Studio Code. VS Code is a lightweight IDE from Microsoft with extensions for C and C++ syntax. 

General:
	Avoid global variables as much as possible.
	Indent for readability. An indent is one tab.
	Comments should be placed on the line before.
	Strive for readability most of all.
	Avoid white space except for when it aids in readability and between function declarations.

Formatting:
	Function braces:
		void myFunction(){

		}
	if, else, while, etc:
		if(thing)
		{
			//stuff
		}

Variable Declarations
	Local variables should be declared in lower camel case. (int myInt)
	Names of variable names should be kept clear and concise.
	Constants should be declared in all caps. (MAX_BUFFER_SIZE)
	Variable declaration happens preferably at the top of a function with similar types declared on the same line unless it needs to be initialized or becomes excessive.

Functions:
	Function names should be upper Camel Case. (void MyFoo)
	Functions should not be so long that they require scrolling through. 
	Functions should do exactly what the name says they do and nothing else.
	If there's an opportunity to refactor by pulling out code and creating a new function, do so.
